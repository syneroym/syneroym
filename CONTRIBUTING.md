# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Syneroym. The project is in early formation.

## Current Status
- The product spec is being finalized.
- Architecture and core substrate are being designed.
- APIs are unstable and will change without notice.

## How To Contribute (Early Stage)
1. Open an issue describing the problem or proposal.
2. Keep scope small and specific.
3. Avoid large refactors until Phase 1 scope is locked.

## Code Style
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Add brief comments only when the code is non-obvious.
- Include tests for behavior where possible.

## Reporting Security Issues
Please do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.
See `SECURITY.md` for the preferred disclosure process.
