# M04B Status

## Slice B2 — Local FDAE (SQL Pushdown Sieve)

### Phase 1 — Policy model & ReBAC→SQL compiler ✅ (2026-07-20, PR #86)

Branch: `feat/m04b-slice-b2-fdae-sieve`. New `crates/fdae` (`syneroym-fdae`):
the typed `Policy` model (`policy.rs`, JSON-Schema-validated against the
embedded `fdae-v1.json`) and the `compile_read` ReBAC→SQL compiler
(`compile.rs`) producing a `CompiledSieve` (`where_clause` + bound `params` +
`masked_fields` + `where_caveats`) for Mode A (Point-In-Time) and Mode B
(Filter). Covers the `WHERE EXISTS`/fused `WITH RECURSIVE` path compilation,
the `visited_track`-equivalent cycle guard (`instr(...)` path-seen check +
`MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` depth backstop), the grant∩policy intersection
(`applicable_permissions`/`close_over_includes`), default-deny (D-04-02-b),
and CLS mask-list derivation from `deny`-lists. `crates/data_db` is
untouched by Phase 1 — nothing in `data_db` calls `compile_read` yet.

Not part of Phase 1 (deferred, tracked below): threading the compiler into
`data_db`'s actual read/delete paths, the watchdog *installation* (the
compiler only documents where it belongs), and the decision trace.

## Phase 2 — `data_db` Integration ✅ (2026-07-20)

Branch: `feat/m04b-slice-b2-data-db`. Plan:
[slice-b2-phase2-data-db-plan.md](slice-b2-phase2-data-db-plan.md). `crates/fdae`
is unchanged in this phase (treated as ground truth per the plan).

### What was delivered

- **New `crates/data_db/src/auth.rs`** — `QueryAuth<'a> { policy, session,
  service_id }` (per-request policy + caller context; `None` at a call site
  preserves today's unfiltered behavior) and `ReadOutcome<T> { value,
  masked_fields }` (the CLS field-mask a read result carries out, since
  `QueryResult`/`RecordReadValue` are WIT-generated types that can't carry a
  host-only field).
- **`ServiceStore` trait (`traits.rs`)** — `get`/`query`/`aggregate`/
  `delete_many` gained an `auth: Option<&QueryAuth<'_>>` parameter; `get`/
  `query` now return `ReadOutcome<T>`; new `check_access` (Mode A
  point-in-time primitive, fail-closed to `Ok(false)`).
- **`sqlite.rs`**:
  - `merge_sieve` ANDs the compiled RLS `where_clause` with each entitling
    capability's caveat `where` (re-compiled via the existing
    `filter::compile_filter`) — dropping `where_caveats` would silently widen
    access beyond what a caveat restricts (the Phase-1 "dropped-caveat" bug
    class).
  - `do_query` — sieve spliced in **first**, ahead of the caller's own JSON
    filter/cursor; final bound-param order is `[sieve…, filter…, cursor,
    limit]`, matching the assembled clause text order.
  - `do_get` — Mode A wrap: `compile_read(..., Mode::PointInTime{id})` already
    ANDs `{table}.id = ?` onto the RLS, so a sieved `get` is one
    self-contained `WHERE` (no separate `id = ?1` alongside it, which would
    double-bind).
  - `check_access`/`do_check_access` — new Mode A primitive. Fail-closed
    (`Ok(false)`) on a `PolicyError`, a caveat-compile error, a watchdog-install
    failure, or a watchdog interrupt; `auth = None` falls back to a plain
    existence check (D3, resolved: no-policy ⇒ existence, not unconditional
    `true`).
  - `delete_many`/`do_delete_many` — sieve compiled as `Mode::Filter` with
    operation `data-layer/write` (D2, resolved: deleting is a write, so a
    read-only permission's `paths` must not become "these rows are
    deletable"), applied on the writer connection (`DbCommand::DeleteMany`
    gained an owned `sieve: Option<CompiledSieve>` field).
  - `do_aggregate`/`aggregate::compile` — the RLS sieve injects into the
    inner query's `WHERE` (param order: `group.params ++ sieve_params ++
    match_params ++ having_params ++ limit_params`); a CLS-active sieve
    (`masked_fields` non-empty) fails the **whole aggregate** closed
    (`PermissionDenied`) rather than attempting a CLS-safe aggregation — an
    aggregate accumulator can leak a masked field's value without ever
    projecting the raw column.
  - Watchdog matrix — `install_watchdog`/`ProgressGuard` (progress-only,
    clear-on-drop, unlike `QueryRawGuard` which also clears an authorizer the
    sieve paths never install), aliasing `FDAE_MAX_VM_OPS =
    QUERY_RAW_MAX_VM_OPS` as the interim hard-coded budget. Installed **only**
    when a sieve is present (the policy-absent path is byte-for-byte
    unchanged). An interrupt maps to `QuotaExceeded` for `do_query`/`do_get`/
    `do_delete_many` (Mode B) and to `Ok(false)` for `do_check_access` (Mode
    A).
- **All four existing call sites** thread `auth = None`, preserving today's
  behavior exactly: `sandbox_wasm/src/host_capabilities.rs` (WASM guest
  dispatch — real `QueryAuth` construction from `HostState`'s policy/session
  is Phase 3), `control_plane/src/synsvc_native.rs` (native dispatch),
  `data_db/benches/security_config_bench.rs` and
  `sandbox_wasm/benches/data_layer_bench.rs`, and `data_db/src/tests_crud.rs`
  (25 call sites across `get`/`query`/`aggregate`/`delete_many`).

### Tests

- **`crates/data_db/src/tests_fdae.rs`** (new, 11 integration tests, real SQL
  against seeded rows through the `ServiceStore` trait with a real compiled
  `Policy` + hand-built `SessionContext`s):
  - Mode B excludes an unreachable row (empty result, not an error).
  - Mode A `check_access` allows the reachable row, denies the unreachable
    one; a no-`auth` call is a plain existence check (D3).
  - `get` of an unreachable-but-existing row returns `None` (ADR-0007 "no
    result is a valid outcome"), not an error.
  - `aggregate` is row-filtered identically to `query`, and denied outright
    when CLS is active.
  - `masked_fields` is exposed on `ReadOutcome` for a CLS policy, but the row
    itself is still unmasked in Phase 2 (the strip is Phase 3 — pinned
    explicitly so a passing test isn't misread as satisfying the task.md CLS
    row).
  - `delete_many` is filtered as a **write** operation: a read-only capability
    deletes nothing; a write capability deletes only the caller's own row.
  - Binding order: sieve ∧ a capability's caveat `where` ∧ the caller's own
    JSON filter, together, return the correct row.
  - A policy-declared relation target whose physical table was never created
    fails closed — Mode B surfaces an error (not an empty-but-successful
    leak), Mode A returns `Ok(false)` (never `Ok(true)`).
  - `auth` present but the policy names no definition for the collection
    stays unfiltered (not strict) — the `compile_read` `Ok(None)` branch.
- **`crates/data_db/src/sqlite.rs`** (new, 4 unit tests in the existing
  private `tests` module): a hand-built pathological `CompiledSieve` (mirrors
  `tests_crud.rs`'s existing `test_query_raw_bounds_compute_independent_of_
  row_count` trick, since `crates/fdae`'s own `MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH` caps any
  *policy-compiled* recursive relation at 64 steps — far too cheap to ever
  approach `FDAE_MAX_VM_OPS`; what's under test here is `data_db`'s own
  watchdog wiring, not the compiler) confirms a watchdog interrupt maps to
  `QuotaExceeded` for `do_query`/`do_get`/`do_delete_many` and to `Ok(false)`
  for `do_check_access`, and that the connection remains fully usable
  afterward (the guard cleared on drop).
- `tests_crud.rs`/benches — call sites updated only, no new assertions; all
  102 pre-existing tests stay green on the `auth = None` path, proving zero
  behavior change.

### Verification evidence

- `cargo +nightly fmt --all` — clean.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features` — zero warnings.
- `cargo test -p syneroym-data-db` — **117 passed, 0 failed** (102
  pre-existing + 11 new FDAE integration + 4 new watchdog unit).
- `cargo test --workspace` — all crates green. (One test,
  `syneroym-coordinator-iroh`'s `connection_limit::
  accepts_up_to_cap_and_rejects_the_rest`, fails under this CLI's default
  network sandbox — "Operation not permitted" binding a UDP relay socket to
  `127.0.0.1:0` — pre-existing/environmental, unrelated to this change;
  confirmed by rerunning the full workspace suite with the sandbox disabled,
  which passed with zero failures.)
- `mise run test:e2e` — not run. Phase 2 has no WIT-boundary or
  guest-visible behavior change (`check-access`'s WIT export is Phase 3; the
  four wired call sites all pass `auth = None`, byte-for-byte identical to
  pre-Phase-2 behavior), so there is nothing new for the Playwright e2e
  suite to exercise. A deliberate skip, not an oversight — recorded per the
  plan's own scoping (§13).

### Explicitly out of Phase 2 scope (plan §12, items 8–10 — recorded, not silently dropped)

- **Decision trace** — deferred to Phase 5 (would require an `fdae` API
  change to surface a `DecisionTrace` alongside `CompiledSieve`, reopening
  Phase 1).
- **Policy/substrate-configurable watchdog budget** — `FDAE_MAX_VM_OPS` is
  the interim hard-coded constant; real configurability needs an `fdae`
  schema change (a `budget` field) plus Phase 4 substrate-config plumbing.
- **Write-side Tier-3 enforcement** (single-row `put`/`patch`/`delete`
  authorization) — scheduled as Slice B5-fdae, gated on sub-decision
  D-04-02-f (creation authorization). `delete_many` is filtered by this
  phase; single-row `delete`/`patch` are not.
- **CLS field-stripping** — Phase 3 lands the host-side final projection
  (above the stage-4 hook, below the WIT response). Phase 2's job is only to
  surface `masked_fields` out of the store via `ReadOutcome`; task.md's CLS
  Failure/Security row stays open until Phase 3.
